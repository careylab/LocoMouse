--|Intro|-- 
LocoMouse_Tracker is a software developed in MATLAB R2013 for tracking
features of locomoting mice when observing them from the side and
bottom view simultaneously. It uses Support Vector Machines to learn
image filters for each of the features and a multi-target tracking
framework to resolve the most likely tracks from the image observations.
This software was developed for a specific setup, and so replicating such
conditions is essential for it to work as intended. The general framework
is, however, flexible enough to be modified for a different setup.

--|Requirements|-- 

Matlab toolboxes: 
- Image processing toolbox 
- Parallel toolbox (not strictly required, but very slow otherwise). 
- Signal processing toolbox - Statistics toolbox

Additional packages (already included): 
- A modified version of the following algorithm:

Efficient Second Order Multi-Target Tracking with Exclusion Constraints
Russel C., Setti F., Agapito L. British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC
2011), Dundee, UK, 2011.

- sc (https://github.com/ojwoodford/sc)

- combinator
(http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24325-combinator-combinations-and-permutations)

These packages are already included in this release. Please read the
respective copyright and license files before using this software.

--|Usage|-- 
To use this software please edit the MTF_main.m file so the different
paths point to the appropriate folders. An example under a typical
installation of MATLAB is provided. Make sure the path to all the
functions are added to your MATLAB path, including the external packages
folder.

To run the example you will need a video example. Please go to
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hfu0sayfzwoqwp1/AADcMwYPl0UHw8jTDIRIHBtoa?dl=0
 and download 'G6AE1_98_28_1_control_S1T1.avi' and
 'G6AE1_98_28_1_control_S1T.png' into the
 LocoMouse/movies/3_11_2013_S1/G6AE1 folder.

Optionally, you can also download the contents of
'G6AE1_98_28_1_control_S1T1_corrected' into LocoMouse/output/Distortion
images/G6AE1_98_28_1_control_S1T1_corrected. This will save computational
time.

The list of specific files to track function follows the specific naming
convention of our system and therefore should be used carefully.

Binaries for 64bit Linux and Windows are included. If using a different
system, please compile the 'combinator' and 'tracking' packages under
'LocoMouse/external packages'.

In recent versions of MATLAB the behaviour of VideoReader has changed.
Therefore, if problems arise, move (and rename accordingly) the functions
inside 'LocoMouse/tracking code/matlab2014' to the 'LocoMouse/tracking
code' folder.

--|Practical Use and Limitations|-- 
The SVM models are dependent on the image conditions used to train them.
To use the provided SVM models, please make sure the following conditions
apply:

* Images must be grayscale.

* Images must be resized such that features have the expected size in
pixels as no multiresolution analysis is performed (for reference, the
size of the bottom view detector for the paw is 30x30 pixels). The system
is capable of rescaling, but needs user input on the scaling factor.

* Background must be subtracted.

* Mice must be black. For other colours, consider training a new SVM
model. However, for mice that look white on the image it might not be
possible to distinguish paws from body on the bottom view, which would
break the system.
